"""Real-network smoke test against OpenRouter.

Marked ``@pytest.mark.integration`` — excluded from ``make test`` by default.
Run explicitly with:

    uv run --package bss-orchestrator pytest orchestrator/tests/test_llm_integration.py -m integration

Requires ``BSS_LLM_API_KEY`` to be set (OpenRouter key). If absent, the test
is skipped rather than failed — local CI runs without credentials.

Scope: **prove the wiring, not the model.** We ask the LLM a trivial
question that exercises one tool call (``clock.now``), and assert:

1. The LLM actually produced an ``AIMessage`` (answer came back).
2. At least one tool invocation occurred.
3. No auth/config error was raised.

We intentionally do NOT assert the final text wording — small models
phrase things differently on every run.

v0.13 — uses ``astream_once`` directly (the in-memory ``Session``
class was retired; multi-turn now goes through the cockpit's
``Conversation`` store + ``astream_once(transcript=...)``).
