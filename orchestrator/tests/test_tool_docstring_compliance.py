"""Semantic-layer test — every registered tool has a full docstring.

The LLM sees each tool's description via its docstring. The doctrine is:
every tool has ``Args:``, ``Returns:``, ``Raises:`` sections. Missing
sections mean the LLM runs blind, which breaks small models like MiMo v2
Flash in predictable ways (fabricated IDs, wrong enums, skipped recoveries).

This test is grep-strict. If a new tool is added without the three sections,
the test fails with a message pointing at the tool name.
