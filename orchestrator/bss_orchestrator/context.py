"""Channel/actor context for outbound bss-clients calls.

Every HTTP call from the CLI or orchestrator propagates three headers so the
downstream services (CRM's interaction auto-logging in particular) know who
did what through which surface:

    X-BSS-Actor    — human user or LLM model slug
    X-BSS-Channel  — ``cli`` | ``llm`` | ``scenario``
    X-Request-ID   — request correlation ID

This module wraps ``bss_clients.set_context`` in two convenience helpers:

    use_cli_context()   → channel=cli,  actor=cli-user
    use_llm_context()   → channel=llm,  actor=llm-<model-slug>

Phase 10's scenario runner will add ``use_scenario_context(name)``.
