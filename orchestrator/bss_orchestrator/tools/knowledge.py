"""v0.20 — knowledge.search + knowledge.get tools (operator_cockpit only).

The cockpit's failure mode pre-v0.20 was paraphrasing handbook /
runbook content from the LLM's training data, which is stale. v0.20
indexes the doc corpus into ``knowledge.doc_chunk`` (Postgres FTS,
optionally pgvector embeddings) and exposes two tools the LLM
**must** call before claiming "the handbook says..." anything.

The citation guard in the REPL + browser cockpit (see
``cli/bss_cli/repl.py`` + ``portals/csr/bss_csr/routes/cockpit.py``)
catches un-cited handbook claims and replaces them with a templated
fallback pointing at ``bss admin knowledge search "<query>"``.

These tools live in the ``operator_cockpit`` profile only. Customer
chat does NOT get them by doctrine — the handbook + runbooks describe
destructive operator flows + perimeter posture, none of which belongs
in customer chat. Greppable rule + ``validate_profiles()`` enforces.

    architecture, decisions, tool surface, roadmap, contributing).

    CALL THIS FIRST for every operator question that isn't a direct
    list/show/get of platform data. That includes:
      - "how do I X" / "how does X work" / "what's the procedure for X"
      - "what is X" / "what does X mean" / "what's the difference between X and Y"
      - "where do I find X" / "what file/section covers X"
      - "is X allowed" / "what's the rule on X" / "what's the doctrine on X"
      - "what env var / setting / flag controls X"
      - "what command do I run to X"

    Your training data is months stale and frequently wrong about
    post-v0.x doctrine. The corpus IS the authoritative source. If
    you are about to write prose explaining something rather than
    rendering tool output, you should have called this tool first.

    Cite the returned ``anchor`` + ``source_path`` in your reply, e.g.
    ``[HANDBOOK §8.4](docs/HANDBOOK.md#84-rotate-api-tokens)``. The
    citation guard at the REPL + browser surface replaces un-cited
    first-person handbook claims with a templated fallback.

    Args:
        query: Natural-language search query, e.g. "rotate cockpit token",
            "prebaked KYC env flag", "how does roaming exhaustion work".
        k: How many top hits to return. Default 3.
        kinds: Optional list of doc kinds to scope the search. Useful for
            "is this allowed?" questions (set ``kinds=["doctrine"]``) or
            "how do I..." questions (set ``kinds=["handbook", "runbook"]``).
            Valid kinds: ``handbook``, ``doctrine``, ``runbook``,
            ``architecture``, ``decisions``, ``tool_surface``, ``roadmap``,
            ``contributing``. Omit for cross-corpus search.

    Returns:
        ``{"hits": [{"anchor", "source_path", "heading_path", "kind",
        "snippet", "content"}, ...], "query": "..."}``.

        IMPORTANT: read ``content`` to answer, NOT ``snippet``.
        ``snippet`` is a short ts_headline excerpt for ranking display.
        ``content`` is the FULL chunk — env var lists, command tables,
        step-by-step procedures all live there. If you answer from
        ``snippet``, you'll cut off in the middle of the actual
        information and feel weak. Use ``content``.

        Empty hits = no relevant content. Don't answer from training
        data; tell the operator what you searched and what you didn't
        find.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: BSS_DB_URL not set on the orchestrator process.
            Configuration error, not a runtime miss.
