"""Customer-scoped tool wrappers — the prompt-injection containment layer (v0.12).

Every ``*.mine`` / ``*_for_me`` tool here is a thin wrapper around its
canonical tool. The wrapper:

1. Reads ``customer_id`` from ``auth_context.current().actor`` — never
   from a parameter. The signature simply omits ``customer_id``;
   ``_profiles.validate_profiles()`` enforces this at startup.

2. For wrappers that accept a resource id (subscription_id, etc.),
   pre-checks ownership against the bound actor and refuses with a
   structured ``policy.<tool>.not_owned_by_actor`` error if the
   resource belongs to someone else. Server-side policies remain the
   primary boundary; the wrapper's pre-check produces a friendlier
   error and ensures the chat-surface LLM never sees the canonical
   tool's structured-error string for cross-customer attempts.

3. Calls the canonical tool internally with the actor-bound ids.

The wrappers add no new server-side capability — they narrow the
prompt-visible surface so the LLM cannot even *attempt* to act on
another customer. Server-side policies still gate every write, so a
hypothetical wrapper bug cannot widen the policy boundary.

PR2 ships the read-only wrappers below. PR3 adds the writes.
