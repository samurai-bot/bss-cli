"""LLM tool surface — importing this package populates ``TOOL_REGISTRY``.

Every tool module decorates its functions with ``@register(...)`` at import
time. Importing the sub-modules below is therefore sufficient to assemble
the full registry; downstream code should consume ``TOOL_REGISTRY`` /
``get_tool`` / ``list_tools`` rather than reaching into modules directly.

v0.12: ``mine_wrappers`` registers the ``customer_self_serve`` profile's
``*.mine`` / ``*_for_me`` tools alongside the canonical ones, and
``_profiles.validate_profiles()`` runs at import time as a fail-fast
check that no profile drifts and no wrapper grew a forbidden parameter.
