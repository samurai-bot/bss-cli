"""Orchestrator-side auth context — the customer scoping seam (v0.12).

The ``customer_self_serve`` profile's ``*.mine`` tool wrappers read the
logged-in customer's id from ``auth_context.current().actor``. This
module is that seam.

It mirrors the service-side ``auth_context.py`` shape (``current()`` +
``AuthContext`` dataclass) so the wrappers read uniformly regardless
of where they execute. The orchestrator's value is set by
``astream_once(actor=...)`` for the duration of one stream and reset
on exit; concurrent streams in different asyncio Contexts each see
their own actor.

Doctrine: the wrappers MUST use ``current()`` rather than reaching
into ``bss_clients._actor_var``. The two values are coupled (the chat
route passes the same id to both) but the orchestrator-side context
is the explicit, documented seam — the bss-clients ContextVar is an
internal implementation detail of the HTTP propagation layer.

Per CLAUDE.md anti-pattern (v0.12+): no ``*.mine`` tool may accept a
``customer_id`` parameter — the binding always comes from here.
