"""Race-condition regression for ``handle_usage_rated``.

The ``customer_signup_and_exhaust`` hero scenario flaked intermittently
when two ``usage.rated`` events arrived back-to-back for the same
subscription. Even though ``handle_usage_rated`` issues
``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` and the lock is acquired correctly at the
DB level, SQLAlchemy returned a CACHED Python object from the
session's identity map instead of the freshly-fetched row. Cache
was populated earlier in the same handler by
``self._repo.get(sub_id)``, which selectinload-eager-loads
``Subscription.balances``.

The fix: ``populate_existing=True`` on the FOR UPDATE statement so
SQLAlchemy overwrites the cached object with the fresh DB read.

This test proves the fix without spinning up a real RabbitMQ +
two concurrent consumers — it reproduces the cache-staleness
mechanism in a single session.
