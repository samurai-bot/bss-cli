        ``populate_existing=True`` is load-bearing here: the caller almost
        always reaches this method via ``handle_usage_rated``, which first
        calls ``self._repo.get(sub_id)`` — and that method ``selectinload``s
        ``Subscription.balances``, populating the session's identity map

        returns the CACHED Python object (with ``consumed`` from before
        any concurrent transaction's commit), even though the SQL query
        DOES re-hit Postgres and the DB lock IS held. Result: two
        concurrent ``handle_usage_rated`` events for the same balance
        each read ``consumed=0``, both write their delta on top of zero,
        and the second commit overwrites the first instead of accumulating.

        reproducer pattern (back-to-back usage events, prefetch_count=5).
