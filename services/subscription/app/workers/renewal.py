"""v0.18 — automated subscription-renewal worker.

In-process tick loop attached to the subscription service's lifespan
(`app.dependencies.lifespan`). The worker is the ONLY place that
triggers renewals automatically; the manual paths
(`subscription.renew_now` cockpit tool, `bss subscription renew` CLI,
scenario action) remain as operator escape hatches.

Doctrine (CLAUDE.md v0.18+):
- Worker calls ``SubscriptionService.renew(sub_id)`` and nothing else.
  No re-implementation of charge logic, no parallel state machine.
- Trigger lives only in this module + the lifespan that starts it.
  Greppable: `_renewal_tick_loop` / `_sweep_due` / `_sweep_skipped`
  must not appear in any other production code path.

Correctness invariants:

1. **Mark-before-dispatch.** The SELECT-FOR-UPDATE-SKIP-LOCKED batch
   commits the `last_renewal_attempted_at` write BEFORE releasing the
   row locks. A peer replica running its own sweep at the same moment
   sees the marked dedup column the instant the lock is gone, so it
   skips the row. Without this ordering, two replicas can each grab a
   batch, both write the mark, both proceed to charge — double billing.

2. **Per-id session for dispatch.** Each `renew()` call runs in its own
   `async with session_factory()` so a single subscription's failure
   does NOT poison the rest of the batch. Errors per id log and
   continue.

3. **ContextVar reset in finally.** The publisher reads
   `actor`/`channel`/`service_identity` from `auth_context._current`,
   which is per-asyncio-Task. The worker is one long-lived Task, so
   values would leak across iterations. `auth_context.push()` returns
   a Token; `pop(token)` in `finally` resets.

4. **Cancellation semantics.** The outer loop catches
   `asyncio.CancelledError` to log the shutdown signal and re-raise.
   In-flight `renew()` calls are NOT shielded — they roll back via
   their `async with session_factory()` and the next process picks
   them up because `last_renewal_attempted_at` was committed by the
   (already-flushed) SELECT-txn.

5. **Wall-clock interval, bss_clock WHERE.** `asyncio.sleep(interval)`
   uses real wall-clock time so the loop's cadence is the operator
   contract (`BSS_RENEWAL_TICK_SECONDS`). The WHERE clause uses
   `bss_clock.now()` so frozen-clock scenarios drive the worker
   deterministically.
