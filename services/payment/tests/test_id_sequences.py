"""Test that ID generation survives app restart (Postgres sequences, not counters).

Creates two payment methods, simulates restart by creating a new app instance,
creates a third, verifies no PK collision and IDs are monotonically increasing.

NOTE: This test uses real commits (not rolled-back transactions) because it
needs to verify cross-restart behavior. It cleans up after itself.
