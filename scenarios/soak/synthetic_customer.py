"""Per-customer per-day event loop for the v0.12 soak.

Each ``SyntheticCustomer`` is bound to one already-provisioned BSS
customer + an already-minted portal_auth session cookie. The day
loop fires events probabilistically using the rates from
phases/V0_12_0.md §5.1:

* 10%/day: open the dashboard and look around (read).
* 5%/day: chat with the assistant — pick from corpus.NORMAL_ASKS.
* 1%/day: chat with an escalation trigger from
  corpus.ESCALATION_TRIGGERS — the agent should call
  ``case.open_for_me`` and the resulting case should carry a
  ``chat_transcript_hash``.
* 0.5%/day: top-up via direct /top-up POST (post-login direct route,
  not chat).
* 0.1%/day: cross-customer probe — chat with one of
  corpus.CROSS_CUSTOMER_PROBES and assert the agent does NOT leak
  another customer's data. The trip-wire stays at zero.

Every chat turn is timed end-to-end (POST → SSE drained → final
event observed) so the soak's metrics aggregator can compute the
p99. Cross-customer probes are also chat turns; their measured
outcome is "agent refused without leak".
