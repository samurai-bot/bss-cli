"""Fixed corpus of customer chat asks for the v0.12 soak.

Per phases/V0_12_0.md §5.1:

* ~50 realistic asks across the chat surface's documented capabilities.
* 5 prompts per non-negotiable escalation category (5 categories,
  intentionally narrow). The escalation rate is 1%/customer/day so
  these fire infrequently but every category gets exercised over
  the 14-day window across 100 customers.
* A small set of cross-customer attempts to exercise the wrappers'
  ownership pre-check + the trip-wire's defence-in-depth posture.

All strings are deterministic — the soak's randomness comes from
the per-event coin flip in ``synthetic_customer``, not from prompt
generation. Reproducible runs are a soak prerequisite.
