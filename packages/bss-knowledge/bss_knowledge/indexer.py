"""Walk INDEXED_PATHS, chunk on headings, upsert into knowledge.doc_chunk.

Three idempotency layers (cheap → expensive):

1. **mtime cache**: skip whole files whose `source_mtime` matches the
   prior run AND whose content_hash matches. Free.
2. **content_hash dedup**: hash each chunk's content; skip rows where
   hash unchanged.
3. **deterministic id**: sha256(source_path|anchor) so a re-anchored
   section (same anchor, different content) updates in place rather
   than landing a duplicate row.

Deletion: any row whose source_path is in INDEXED_PATHS but whose
(source_path, anchor) pair is NOT in the freshly chunked set is
deleted. This catches removed sections and removed files.
