"""Doc allowlist for the knowledge indexer.

This is the **doctrine source of truth** for what the cockpit knowledge
tool can cite. Adding a new path requires a doctrine review (a new
DECISIONS.md entry); adding `phases/V0_*.md` is a doctrine bug
(grep guard 16 in `make doctrine-check`).

Why no glob:

* Globs invite drift. Someone adds `docs/internal/*.md` and ships it
  to the LLM without anyone noticing.
* The corpus is small enough (sub-1MB) that explicitness is cheap.
* Each file's `kind` is meaningful for the search ranking — globs
  obscure that.

`KIND_FOR_PATH` maps each indexed path to a `kind` string used by:

* The `kinds=[...]` filter on `knowledge.search` (e.g. operator scopes
  to `["doctrine", "handbook"]` for an "is this allowed?" question).
* Re-ranking (Tier-1 hybrid): doctrine outranks runbooks for
  prohibition queries; handbook outranks decisions for how-to queries.
