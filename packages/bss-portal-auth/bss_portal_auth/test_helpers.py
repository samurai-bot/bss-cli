"""Test helpers — DO NOT IMPORT FROM PRODUCTION CODE.

Tests use these to:

* Spin up an in-process ``NoopEmailAdapter`` whose records are
  inspectable via ``last_login_codes(adapter, email)``.
* Mint a session for a verified identity bypassing the email flow,
  via ``create_test_session``. The portal route tests use this so they
  don't have to drive the full magic-link flow for every assertion.

Production callers go through ``service.py``. Anything in this module
that escapes into a route handler is a bug.
