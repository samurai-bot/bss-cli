"""Portal-side audit helper — append a ``portal_auth.portal_action`` row.

v0.10: every direct post-login self-serve write records one row here
after the BSS write resolves (success or failure). The function takes
already-resolved primitives (``customer_id``, ``identity_id``, etc.)
so this module stays free of FastAPI / Request imports — the same
layering as ``_record_attempt`` for ``login_attempt``.

Caller pattern (from a portal route handler):

    try:
        result = await clients.subscription.purchase_vas(...)
        await record_portal_action(
            db,
            customer_id=customer_id,
            identity_id=identity.id,
            action="vas_purchase",
            route="/top-up",
            method="POST",
            success=True,
            step_up_consumed=True,
            ip=request.client.host if request.client else None,
            user_agent=request.headers.get("user-agent"),
        )
        await db.commit()
    except PolicyViolationFromServer as exc:
        await record_portal_action(
            db,
            ...,
            success=False,
            error_rule=exc.rule,
            ...,
        )
        await db.commit()
        raise

The portal owns the transaction; this module flushes but does not
commit. Same pattern as the rest of ``bss_portal_auth``.
