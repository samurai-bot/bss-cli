"""Email-change two-step flow with cross-schema atomic verification (v0.10 PR 8).

V0_10_0.md "Do not consider the email-change flow done until the
rollback test passes" — the CRM contact-medium update and the
``portal_auth.identity.email`` update must commit together or roll
back together. Sequential commits leave the system in a mismatched
state (CRM has new email, portal_auth has old one) with no easy
recovery; that is the explicit anti-pattern v0.10 forbids.

This module is the single, named place where the cross-schema write
lives. Both schemas (``crm`` and ``portal_auth``) live in the same
Postgres instance, so a single ``AsyncSession`` transaction spans
them. ``bss_portal_auth`` is the right home for the function: it
already owns the portal-side identity layer + the DB session, and
``bss_models`` exports both schemas' ORM classes.

Doctrine note: writing directly to ``crm.contact_medium`` from a
non-CRM module is a deliberate, narrow exception to "writes go
through service-side policies." The exception is documented in
DECISIONS 2026-04-27 (the "v0.10 PR 8" entry). Future flows that
need similar atomicity must either (a) use this same exception with
a documented justification, (b) add a service-side composite
operation, or (c) pick a saga pattern with explicit compensation.
The default is still "go through the service HTTP API."

Public surface:

* ``start_email_change(db, identity_id, new_email, ip, user_agent,
  email_adapter)`` — uniqueness check, mint OTP, persist pending row,
  send OTP to the *new* email. Caller commits.
* ``verify_email_change(db, identity_id, code)`` — match OTP against
  pending row, atomically: update CRM contact_medium for email +
  update portal_auth.identity.email + mark pending consumed. Caller
  commits.
* ``cancel_pending_email_change(db, identity_id)`` — explicit cancel.
* ``EmailChangeStarted`` / ``EmailChangeFailed`` / ``EmailChangeApplied`` —
  result types so the route handler can branch without parsing
  exceptions.

    All four operations land in the same ``AsyncSession`` — i.e. the

    caller commits, or none of them stick:

    1. Match the OTP against the active pending row for this identity.
       Code mismatch / expired / no-row → return ``EmailChangeFailed``
       *before* writing anything.
    2. Find the customer linked to this identity, then the party's

       ``value`` to the new email.

    ``EmailChangeApplied``. On any of the failure branches the caller
    must ``rollback`` (or just commit the no-op state — no writes
    happened).

    The cross-schema write is the doctrine bend documented in
    DECISIONS 2026-04-27. The justification is that splitting the
    update across two HTTP calls (CRM, then portal_auth) leaves a
    half-committed state if the second call fails, which is exactly
    what V0_10_0.md "Do not silently downgrade the email-change
