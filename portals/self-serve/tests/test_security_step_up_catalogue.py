"""v0.10 — SENSITIVE_ACTION_LABELS catalogue + requires_step_up gate.

Locks in:

* The catalogue is a frozenset and contains every label V0_10_0.md
  enumerates as sensitive.
* ``requires_step_up`` rejects unknown labels at dependency
  construction time — protects against typos that would otherwise
  silently disable the step-up gate (the previous failure mode: a
  route that requires_step_up("sub_terminate") would have *failed
  open* because the consume call would never find a matching grant
  and the user would just bounce back through the step-up flow).

The cross-check between the catalogue and route call sites lands in
PR 11 (final doctrine guards), once every PR 3–10 route exists.
