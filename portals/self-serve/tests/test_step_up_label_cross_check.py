"""v0.10 PR 11 — every SENSITIVE_ACTION_LABELS entry is used by ≥1 route.

V0_10_0.md Track 10.2 + 10.3:
* Every label in the catalogue must appear in at least one
  ``requires_step_up(...)`` call site under
  ``portals/self-serve/bss_self_serve/routes/``.
* Every ``requires_step_up(...)`` call site uses a label from the
  set (this half is enforced at construction time by
  ``security.requires_step_up`` itself, but we double-check here).

Adding a sensitive route requires extending the catalogue + this
test stays green automatically.
