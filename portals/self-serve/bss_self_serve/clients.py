"""bss-clients factory for the self-serve portal (v0.9+, extended in v0.10).

The portal is a customer-facing surface; v0.9 gives it its own
identity at the BSS perimeter via ``BSS_PORTAL_SELF_SERVE_API_TOKEN``. Outbound
calls from this factory carry that token, so receiving services
resolve ``service_identity = "portal_self_serve"`` from token
validation. Audit / log / OTel see writes initiated through the
portal as distinct from orchestrator/CSR/scenario traffic.

Backwards compat: if ``BSS_PORTAL_SELF_SERVE_API_TOKEN`` is unset (rolling out
the named-token model staged across environments), the provider
falls back to ``BSS_API_TOKEN``. Receiving services then resolve
``service_identity = "default"`` for those calls. Logging surfaces
this with a one-time warning so operators notice and provision the
named token.

Doctrine note (V0_10_0.md Track 1):

* **(v0.4–v0.9 / signup + chat)** Route handlers on the signup funnel
  and the ``/chat`` surface continue routing writes through the LLM
  orchestrator via ``agent_bridge.*`` → ``astream_once``. Reads via
  this factory.
* **(v0.10+ / post-login self-serve)** Routes behind
  ``requires_linked_customer`` may write directly through this
  factory. The customer principal is bound from
  ``request.state.customer_id``; per-resource ownership policies and
  step-up auth gate sensitive writes; one route = one write call.

``make doctrine-check`` enforces the boundary: ``astream_once`` may
only appear in the chat + signup routes; ``customer_id`` must come
from ``request.state``, never form/query input.
