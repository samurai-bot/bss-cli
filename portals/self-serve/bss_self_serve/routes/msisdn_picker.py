"""MSISDN picker — /signup/{plan}/msisdn

A small step inserted between plan selection and the signup form so
customers pick their own number instead of having one auto-assigned
during SOM decomposition. This is a READ endpoint — the number is
actually reserved later when ``order.create`` runs through SOM with
``msisdn_preference`` pointing at the chosen value.

We show 12 available numbers (three rows of four on desktop). A
``?prefix=`` query param lets the scenario runner pin to a specific
range. Older numbers (assigned / reserved / recycled) are filtered
out; only ``status == "available"`` lands on the page.

Race note: a number shown as available here could get reserved by
another signup in the ~30-second window between render and
``order.create``. In that case SOM's ``reserve_next_msisdn`` still
succeeds — it falls back to the next available number and stores
the mismatch on the subscription. The portal does not try to
lock-and-hold, by design; it's a demo.
