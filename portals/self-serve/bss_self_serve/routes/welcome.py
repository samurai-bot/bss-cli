"""Public landing pages — /welcome and /plans.

Both routes are explicitly in ``security.PUBLIC_EXACT_PATHS`` so the
session middleware doesn't redirect anonymous visitors. CTAs route
to ``/auth/login?next=...`` for unauthenticated viewers; signed-in
viewers can click straight through to the gated funnel.

Doctrine (V0_8_0.md §3.2):
* ``/welcome`` is the public marketing surface — sign-in / get-started.
* ``/plans`` lists active offerings and lets the visitor pick one.
  The "Choose this plan" CTA goes to ``/auth/login?next=/signup/<plan>/msisdn``
  for anonymous viewers; the gated route raises ``RedirectToLogin``
  with the same next path, so we don't need template branching.
