"""Customer-facing strings for ``PolicyViolation.rule`` codes (v0.10).

The BSS services raise ``PolicyViolationFromServer(rule=..., message=...,
context=...)`` — the ``message`` is engineer-shaped (operator-readable
diagnostic), the ``rule`` is a stable code suitable for i18n. This
module is the i18n stub: it maps ``rule`` to a customer-facing string.

Doctrine (V0_10_0.md Track 10.4):

* Known rule → render the mapped string verbatim. Context values are
  not interpolated by default; if a rule needs context, add a callable
  to ``RULE_FORMATTERS`` so the formatter is a code review point.
* Unknown rule → fall back to a generic apology. The portal also
  writes a ``portal_action`` audit row with ``error_rule=<rule>`` so
  ops can review and add a customer-facing string later.

The catalogue is intentionally shallow. New rules show up in the
audit table first; mappings are added by humans, not generated. This
prevents the "every internal error string leaks to customers"
anti-pattern that comes with auto-deriving customer copy from rule
codes.
