"""In-memory signup session store.

A signup spans many requests: the POST that runs ``customer.create``,
the GET that lands on the progress page, and the HTMX-triggered step
routes that run the rest of the chain (``customer.attest_kyc``,
``payment.add_card``, ``com.create_order``, ``com.get_order`` polling).
They all share form input + the per-step results (CUST-id, payment
method id, order id, subscription id, activation code).

Production portals would put this in Redis. v0.4 was a demo — one
process, one dict, TTL-bounded. v0.11 keeps the same posture for the
direct-write signup chain because the demo invariant is identical: if
the process restarts mid-signup the user loses their session, and
that's still acceptable per V0_4_0.md §3.

Thread/async safety: protected by a single ``asyncio.Lock`` so
``create_session`` / ``get_session`` / ``update_session`` can be
called from route handlers without race-in-place on the dict. No
cross-process sharing; scaling beyond one replica requires swapping
this module for Redis.
