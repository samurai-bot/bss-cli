"""Route gating helpers — FastAPI dependencies + public-route allowlist.

The ``PortalSessionMiddleware`` already attached
``request.state.session`` / ``.identity`` / ``.customer_id`` (or None
on miss). These dependencies *enforce* the gates: each one raises a
``RedirectToLogin`` exception, caught by an exception handler and
turned into a 303 redirect.

Doctrine (V0_8_0.md §5):

* ``/welcome``, ``/plans``, ``/auth/*`` are the only paths reachable
  without a session. Adding a public route requires an entry in
  ``PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIXES`` + a test.
* ``request.state.customer_id`` is the only acceptable source of the
  customer id post-login. Routes never accept ``customer_id`` from
  query string or form input.
* Step-up tokens are forwarded as ``X-BSS-StepUp-Token`` header or
  ``step_up_token`` form field; ``requires_step_up`` consumes them
  via ``bss_portal_auth.consume_step_up_token``.
